# TheStudentSaver

This is my final year project, The StudentSaver.

To run this project you will need to download Android Studio or suitable alternative.

Once downloaded, open the program and open this project file inside it.

After the project has been built and you are able to see the project files, you will need to sync the gradle. To do this select Tools -> Files -> Sync Project With Gradle Files.

Once this has completed you will be able to run the project within your chosen emulator by selecting Run -> Run 'app'.

Any issues running the project then please contact me at thomas.j.fox96@icloud.com
